## Start app

To run app locally, run `yarn start` in app root directory. `react-scripts` will start web server at `http://localhost:3000` (or first next free port).
All the Auth functionality such as Sign-up, Login, Reset password etc. requires a backend app. You can either write your own or use the [Node API Starter](https://github.com/Kamahl19/node-api-starter) which works with `React Starter` out of the box.

## Build app

To build app, run `yarn build` in app root directory.

## Project structure

```
-| .github/: GitHub workflows for CI/CD
-| public/: Public assets
-| src/
 |--| app/: Main application (framework) files.
 |--| common/: Base components, services, utils, rules, enums etc. used in the whole app.
 |--| features/: Features bundled into separate modules including containers, components, ducks, apis etc.
 |--| packages/: Our own self-contained libraries that will soon be released as a separate npm packages
 |--| index.tsx: application entry file
-| storybook/: Storybook configuration and addons.
```

## Prettier

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), an opinionated code formatter. In order to format code manually, run `yarn format` in app root directory. All the code is also formatted automatically on `pre-commit` hook.

## ESLint

Project comes with ESLint configured. It helps you prevent common errors.

There are multiple ways how to run ESLint.

- CLI: `yarn lint`
- in browser console while developing (after running `yarn start`)
- it runs automatically on `pre-commit` hook
- in IDE if supported (Visual Studio Code supports reports)

## Storybook

We suggest developing component in isolation. For this reason, project comes with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) pre-configured.

To run separated development environment, run `yarn storybook` which will start dedicated web server at `http://localhost:9009`.

To build static storybook, run `yarn storybook:build`. This creates a static webpage which you can deploy and showcase your components to others.

More information about supported features can be found in [Storybook's Github repository](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)

## i18n

Running `yarn extract-translations` will update alphabetically sorted JSON files with key-translations pairs. It will use default messages for keys without explicit translations.

## Analysing production JS bundle

Project comes with the `source-map-explorer` which analyzes the production JS bundle. To use it just run `yarn build` and then `yarn analyze`.

## Updating dependencies

Project comes with the default [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com) config `renovate.json`. It takes care of automated dependency updates and it's free of charge for open-source projects. More about how to [configure here](https://renovatebot.com/docs).

## CI/CD

We are using [GitHub's Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to run integration checks on each PR. We plan to add deployment of master branch to GH pages as well as deploying the Storybook.

## More Docs & Guides

This project is built on top of `create-react-app` with many [more usefull guides](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
