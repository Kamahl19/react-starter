# React Starter

[![Master CI Status](https://github.com/Kamahl19/react-starter/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Kamahl19/react-starter/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0bece35d-bed0-49ae-8236-08d67acd4031/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-starter-ts/deploys)

## Getting Started

Just clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Kamahl19/react-starter.git` or click on "Use this template" button above.

Master branch is always passing CI build and it's deployed online at https://react-starter-ts.netlify.com

## Keeping up with updates

Once you start building your own app on top of React Starter you will probably want to keep up-to-date with the new updates of React Starter. This can be easily achieved by tracking the latest commit hash of React Starter you use. We suggest this process:

1. When you clone the React Starter repo, don't forget to write down the hash of [latest master's commit](https://github.com/Kamahl19/react-starter/commits/master)
2. Every once in a while, compare the version of React Starter you used with the current version of React Starter like this `https://github.com/Kamahl19/react-starter/compare/{YOUR_LATEST_REACT_STARTER_COMMIT_HASH}...master`
3. Go through the diff and apply the changes in your own app
4. Commit these changes into your own repo with this commit message: `Updating to React Starter hash: {LATEST_REACT_STARTER_COMMIT_HASH}`. This way you always keep the hash of the React Starter's version you currently use in your app

## Start app

To run app locally, run `yarn start` in app root directory. `react-scripts` will start web server in the development mode at `http://localhost:3000` (or first next free port).

All the Auth functionality such as Sign-up, Login, Reset password etc. requires a backend app. You can either write your own or use the [Node API Starter](https://github.com/Kamahl19/node-api-starter) which works with React Starter out of the box.

## Build app

To build the app for production, run `yarn build` in app root directory. Your app is then ready to be deployed! See the [create-react-app Deployment docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Test app

Run `yarn test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See [create-react-app Tests docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Project structure

```
-| .github/: GitHub workflows for CI/CD
-| public/: Public assets
-| src/
 |--| app/: Main application (framework) files.
 |--| common/: Base components, services, utils, rules, enums etc. used in the whole app.
 |--| features/: Features bundled into separate modules including components, screens, ducks, apis etc.
 |--| index.tsx: application entry file
```

## Prettier

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), an opinionated code formatter. In order to format code manually, run `yarn format` in app root directory. All the code is also formatted automatically on `pre-commit` hook. There is also `yarn format-check` for CI purposes to check if code is formatted properly.

## ESLint

Project comes with ESLint configured. It helps you prevent common errors.

There are multiple ways how to run ESLint.

- CLI: `yarn lint`
- in browser console while developing (after running `yarn start`)
- it runs automatically on `pre-commit` hook
- in IDE if supported (Visual Studio Code supports reports)

## i18n

Running `yarn extract-translations` will update alphabetically sorted JSON files with key-translations pairs. It will use default messages for keys without explicit translations.

## Analysing production JS bundle

Project comes with the `source-map-explorer` which analyzes the production JS bundle. To use it just run `yarn analyze`.

## Updating dependencies

Project comes with the default [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com) config `renovate.json`. It takes care of automated dependency updates and it's free for open-source projects. More about how to [configure here](https://renovatebot.com/docs).

## CI/CD

This project is using [GitHub's Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to run [integration tests](.github/workflows/CI.yml) on each PR and Master branch. It includes running eslint, prettier, tests and building the app. PR becomes mergable only if it passes. We also show badge on top of `README.md` to show Master branch status. If you don't use GitHub you can remove the `.github` folder, otherwise follow these steps to configure your GitHub repository:

1. Go to Settings -> Branches -> Add rule
   - Apply to your master branch
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Select build checks being run in CI.yml
2. Update path to your repository (eg. `Kamahl19/react-starter`) and name of the branch for CI badge in `README.md`

This project is using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy each PR and Master branch automatically. If you don't use Netlify you can remove the `netlify.toml` file, otherwise follow these steps to setup Netlify:

1. Follow [Netlify's instructions](https://docs.netlify.com/)
2. Update Netlify status badge in `README.md` according to [these instructions](https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/status-badges/)
